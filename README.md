**E-commerce Sales Dashboard Project: A Comprehensive Yearly Analysis Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI**  

I designed and developed an E-commerce Sales Dashboard to analyze a full year of sales data, divided into four quarters (4-month intervals). The project leveraged SQL, Excel, and Power BI to create an insightful and dynamic reporting solution that empowers data-driven decision-making.  

### Project Workflow  

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning (Excel):**  
   - Imported raw sales data and performed thorough data cleaning to address inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.  
   - Ensured data accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis.  

2. **Data Analysis and Querying (SQL):**  
   - Utilized SQL to process and analyze large datasets efficiently.  
   - Created structured queries to extract insights on key metrics such as revenue, product performance, customer behavior, and seasonal trends.  
   - Organized data into a format suitable for visualization.  

3. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI):**  
   - Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard divided into four segments, one for each quarter, to present insights dynamically.  
   - Incorporated visual storytelling to highlight performance trends and patterns over the year.  

### Dashboard Overview  

1. **Quarter 1 (Months 1-4):**  
   - Focus on post-holiday sales trends, identifying high-demand products and categories.  
   - Insights into customer acquisition and initial engagement for the year.  

2. **Quarter 2 (Months 5-8):**  
   - Analysis of mid-year sales performance and revenue growth.  
   - Identification of opportunities for cross-selling and upselling based on product performance.  

3. **Quarter 3 (Months 9-12):**  
   - Evaluation of pre-holiday sales trends and inventory management.  
   - Customer behavior insights to support targeted marketing campaigns.  

4. **Year-End Summary:**  
   - Consolidated view of yearly performance with KPIs such as total revenue, profit margins, and customer retention rates.  
   - Comparison of quarterly metrics to identify areas of growth and improvement.  

### Key Features and Highlights  

- **Interactive Filters and Slicers:** Allow users to drill down into specific metrics such as product categories, regions, and customer demographics.  
- **Visualizations:** Dynamic charts, graphs, and heatmaps to communicate insights clearly and effectively.  
- **Seasonal Trends:** Insights into how sales varied across different times of the year, helping to align business strategies with market demands.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Highlights opportunities to optimize marketing strategies, improve inventory management, and boost customer engagement.  

### Business Impact  

This project delivers a comprehensive overview of the e-commerce sales cycle, enabling stakeholders to monitor performance, identify growth opportunities, and make informed decisions. By leveraging quarterly insights, the dashboard supports better planning and strategic initiatives throughout the year.  

### Skills Demonstrated  

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring data accuracy and readiness for analysis using Excel.  
- **SQL Querying:** Extracting meaningful insights from large datasets.  
- **Power BI Visualization:** Creating an interactive, user-friendly dashboard for a clear presentation of key findings.  

### Summary
